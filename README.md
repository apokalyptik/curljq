# curljq
A wrapper to combine curl and jq

# But, Like, Why?
A coworker showed me [this](https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/JSON) and said it was interesting. And my first thought/comment was "This could be done with a wrapper script pretty easily, I think." And then my brain simply would not let it go until I had given it a go.

# Sorry, not sorry
I guess give it a try if you like. I'd be happy to hear feedback and if it worked or was useful or didn't (with examples)

# Where do you use this? Is it production quality?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh that was a real question? Lets just move along, maybe? :D
